## Project build system

This document contains instructions on how to build, install and execute all parts of the project: The software library itself, the unit tests, a sample program and the API documentation.

## Prerequisites

The project requires CMake 3.10 or newer to build, and a reasonably modern version of Git to clone the project repository and fetch some Git submodules. Building the API documentation requires Doxygen.

Use your package manager of choice to install these components on your system. On macOS the recommended package manager is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), on Windows it's [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

## How to build

After cloning the repository you must first initialize its Git submodules:

    cd /path/to/project
    git submodule update --init --recursive

In the next step you build libsgfc++ and install it to a well-defined prefix where the SgfcKit build system expects it to be. You can skip this step if you have libsgfc++ installed somewhere else on the system. If it's in a non-default installation path you'll have to define that path to the build system - see the section [Integrating libsgfc++ into the build](#integrating-libsgfc-into-the-build) below for details.

    cd libsgfcplusplus
    ./script/build.sh
    cd build
    cmake --install . --prefix install
    cd ../..

Now you're ready to build. These commands should do it:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    # If you want a debug build then replace "Release" with "Debug"
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    cmake --build .

## How to test

Currently the project does not contain any tests. See [GitHub issue #2](https://github.com/herzbube/SgfcKit/issues/2).

## How to install

After the tests have run successfully you install the build products to a destination folder of your choice. CMake 3.15 and newer include a command line option `--install` which can be used like this:

    cmake --install . --prefix /path/to/destfolder

Older CMake versions don't have the `--install` command line option and you must use the generated build system to perform the installation. You also have to define the prefix folder when you generate the build system. Example for `make`:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/destfolder ..
    [...]
    make install

The following things will be installed:

- Subfolder `lib`: A shared library and a static library.
- Subfolder `include`: The library's public header files.
- Subfolder `Frameworks`: A shared library framework and a static library framework.

## How to generate and install the API documentation

The library's source code is documented with [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.org/) formatted inline comments. To generate the documentation you have to have Doxygen installed.

Generating and installing the API documentation is optional, and therefore is not part of the regular software build. These are the commands that need be invoked separately:

    cd build
    cmake --build   . --target    SgfcKit-doc
    cmake --install . --component SgfcKit-doc --prefix /path/to/destfolder

Notes:

- The generated documentation will be installed in the specified prefix location, in a subfolder `share/doc`. By default this consists of a set of HTML files.
- You can generate and install the documentation without having to build the software first.
- If you want to change the way how the documentation is generated you have to edit `doc/CMakeLists.txt`. In that file you can set variables whose names directly correspond to tags in the Doxygen configuration file. For instance, if you want to have additional LaTeX output you can set `DOXYGEN_GENERATE_LATEX` to `YES`, this will set the corresponding Doxygen tag `GENERATE_LATEX` to `YES`.
- If you modified `doc/CMakeLists.txt` so that Doxygen generates more output formats you also have to edit `doc/SourcesList.cmake` to make sure that the additional output formats are installed. Set the `OUTPUT_DIRECTORIES` variable accordingly.
- By default Doxygen generates documentation for both the public API part and the internal implementation part of the library. If you only want the public API part you can edit `doc/SourcesList.cmake` and change the `SOURCES` variable so that it does not include the `src` subfolder. If you leave the configuration as it is, then you can still focus on just the public API docs by navigating to the "Public API" module in the generated documentation.

## Sample code

Currently the project does not contain any useful sample code beyond a basic working demo on the level of a "Hello World" program. See [GitHub issue #5](https://github.com/herzbube/SgfcKit/issues/5).

## Enabling/disabling build products

The default build builds everything, but if you wish you can disable certain build products by setting the corresponding variables:

- Set `ENABLE_SHARED_LIBRARY` to `NO` to prevent the shared library from being built.
- Set `ENABLE_STATIC_LIBRARY` to `NO` to prevent the static library from being built.
- Set `ENABLE_SHARED_FRAMEWORK` to `NO` to prevent the shared library framework from being built.
- Set `ENABLE_STATIC_FRAMEWORK` to `NO` to prevent the static library framework from being built.
- Set `ENABLE_TESTS` to `NO` to prevent unit tests from being built.
- Set `ENABLE_EXAMPLES` to `NO` to prevent the examples from being built.

The following example builds everything except the static library framework and the examples:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_STATIC_FRAMEWORK=NO -DENABLE_EXAMPLES=NO ..
    cmake --build .

You can also set the variable `ENABLE_DEFAULT` to `NO` as a quick way to change the default from "build everything" to "build nothing". After that you can enable only certain parts.

The following example only builds the shared library:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_DEFAULT=NO -DENABLE_SHARED_LIBRARY=YES ..
    cmake --build .

## Integrating libsgfc++ into the build

The SgfcKit build system integrates libsgfc++ by way of the CMake `find_package()` command. It attempts to locate the package in two steps:

1. First the build system looks for a system-wide package in a series of likely installation paths. The search logic is exceedingly complicated and can be looked up in the CMake documentation of the `find_package()` command.
2. If there is no system-wide package the build system then looks for the package in a defined installation path.

If both lookup attempts fail, the build fails.

You can define the installation path where the build system should look for the package by defining the variable `LIBSGFCPLUSPLUS_INSTALLATION_PREFIX`:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
          -DLIBSGFCPLUSPLUS_INSTALLATION_PREFIX=/path/to/folder \
          ..

If you don't define an installation path, the build system assumes `libsgfcplusplus/build/install` as the default installation path. This path points into the libsgfc++ Git submodule, where it is expected that you previously built and installed libsgfc++ with the following instructions:

    cd libsgfcplusplus
    ./script/build.sh
    cd build
    cmake --install . --prefix install
    cd ../..

## Xcode build

In the previous section you have seen how to generate a Makefile-based build system. Cmake can also generate an Xcode project, like this:

    cd build
    cmake -G Xcode ..
    
    # Launch Xcode with the generated project
    open SgfcKit.xcodeproj

The `ALL_BUILD` target in the Xcode project builds all targets, i.e. both the shared and the static libraries, the shared and static library frameworks, and the unit tests.

The `RUN_TESTS` target builds the unit test target and executes a custom post-build script that is supposed to run the test. The post-build script currently doesn't seem to work. It is therefore recommended building the unit test target (`SgfcKit-test`) and selecting "Product > Run" to execute the test runner. This always works, and Xcode is even nice enough to pop up an output pane that shows you the output of the command line test runner.

The `ZERO_CHECK` target checks whether your `CMakeLists.txt` files have changed and if necessary updates the Xcode project with the changes.

## Cross-compiling for iOS

Cross-compiling for iOS (or for any of the other Apple device OS's) currently seems to be a bit of a moving target in CMake, due to some changes that have been going on in the Apple developer ecosystem in the last years. Driving factors are the introduction of Silicon Macs (i.e. macOS machines running on ARM processors) and the continued evolution of Xcode (e.g. introduction of a new / removal of the old build system).

The next two sections therefore present two ways how to cross-compile for iOS: An old way, which will eventually stop working in future CMake versions (and probably does not even work today on Silicon Macs), and a new way, which may need refinement in the future but should at least work on all machines given modern versions of CMake and Xcode are used.

Both solutions build on CMake's basic mechanics for cross-compiling for iOS, which are explained in the `cmake-toolchains` man page and are also available [from the CMake website](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html#cross-compiling-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos).

### The old way: `IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED`

Here is a set of commands that should work with CMake 3.28.1, on an Intel macOS machine where Xcode 15 is installed. This solution uses the property `IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED`, which  has been deprecated in CMake version 3.28, so the solution will eventually stop working once CMake removes the property completely. Also note that the solution most likely does not work on Silicon Macs - if you have one of these machines then jump ahead to the "new way" section below.

    cd /path/to/SgfcKit
    mkdir build
    
    cd build
    cmake .. -G Xcode \
      -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS \
      "-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64;x86_64" \
      -DCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO \
      -DCMAKE_IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED=YES

    cmake --build . --config Release
    cmake --install . --prefix `pwd`/install

Notes:

- The commands create a Release configuration build. The configuration is not specified in the first command via `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` because the Xcode generator produces a multi-configuration build system which is capable of building both Debug and Release configurations. The configuration therefore must be selected during the `--build` step.
- Because none of the `ENABLE_*` variables is set, the SgfcKit project's CMake configuration internally decides to create only the static library and the static library framework. The reason is to avoid a codesigning error - see the section [Codesigning when building for iOS](#codesigning-when-building-for-ios) for more details.
- We list two architectures: `x86_64` for the simulator build, and `arm64` for the device build. The result of both builds will be stored in the same library files, making them so-called "universal" binaries. Use `lipo -info /path/to/file` to check what's inside such a file. Omitting `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` builds slices for all default architectures.
- Setting the `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH` flag to `NO` is important so that Xcode really builds those architectures we just mentioned. If we didn't set this Xcode would only build the architecture in the `NATIVE_ARCH` Xcode build setting.
- Setting the CMake property `IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED` to `YES` causes the targets to be built for both the device SDK and the simulator SDK. An `arm64` build made with the device SDK is slightly different than an `arm64` build made with the simulator SDK. CMake figures out on its own which SDK it must use to build each architecture. The property also indicates to CMake that it needs to build **all** architectures in `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES`, not just the first, and to stitch together all resulting slices into a universal binary.
- When using a modern version of CMake together with the new Xcode build system (introduced in Xcode 10) it is important that the `--build` and the `--install` steps are done separately, because only then does CMake work correctly with that new Xcode build system.
  - With older versions of CMake it was mandatory to use the old Xcode build system (you had to specify `-T buildsystem 1` to the generate CMake command), **and** it was also mandatory to combine the build and install steps, i.e. to have only a `--build` step during which the option `--target install` is also specified.
  - Because modern Xcode versions no longer support the old build system the combined build/install step approach is no longer viable with modern CMake/Xcode versions.
- In the `--install` step, the `pwd` command is used because CMake requires the installation prefix to be an absolute path.

### The new way: XCFramework

The results of the "old way" solution are universal (aka "fat") binaries: These are binaries that can contain multiple architectures (aka "slices") as long as they are different. On Intel macOS machines this is fine because the simulator build (`x86_64` architecture) and the device build (`arm64` architecture) have different architectures, so it is no problem to store both slices in the same universal binary. On ARM macOS machines (aka Silicon Macs) this does not work, though, because on these machines the simulator build and the device build both use the `arm64` architecture.

Apple's solution for this is a new kind of framework called "XCFramework": This is an enhanced framework bundle (recognizable by the extension `.xcframework`) that can contain any number of binaries for different platforms. It seems that currently CMake does not have built-in support for creating XCFrameworks, instead one has to stitch together an XCFramework bundle manually from individual framework parts using `xcodebuild -create-xcframework`. 

Here is an example that was tested on an Intel Mac, but should also work on a Silicon Mac. Note that this solution no longer uses the deprecated property `IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED`

```
cd /path/to/SgfcKit
mkdir -p build/simulator build/device

cd build/simulator
cmake ../.. -G Xcode -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=iphonesimulator
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --install . --prefix `pwd`/install

cd ../device
cmake ../.. -G Xcode -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=iphoneos
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --install . --prefix `pwd`/install

cd ..
xcodebuild -create-xcframework \
           -framework simulator/install/Frameworks/SgfcKit_static.framework \
           -framework device/install/Frameworks/SgfcKit_static.framework \
           -output SgfcKit_static.xcframework
```

Notes:

- The solution creates two wholly separate builds for the simulator and device platforms, using the same set of generate/build/install commands that were also used in the "old way" solution.
- The `CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT` variable selects the SDK to be used for building each platform. Specifying an SDK name without a version (e.g. `iphonesimulator` instead of `iphonesimulator17.2`) selects the latest SDK version. A list of available SDKs can be obtained by running `xcodebuild -showsdks`.
- We omit `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` and let Xcode build slices for all default architectures of the target platform. On Silicon Macs this should only build only an `arm64` slice for both platforms. On Intel Macs this builds only an `arm64` slice for the device platform, and both `arm64` and `x86_64` slices for the simulator platform. `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64` can be specified to avoid building two slices for the simulator.
- For simplicity's sake the example does not specify any of the `ENABLE_*` variables. This results in both the shared library and the shared library framework to be built, although we only need the framework for stitching the XCFramework. The overhead of building the unneeded shared library is negligible, though, because it consists of the same object files as the framework. To avoid building the shared library, the options `-DENABLE_DEFAULT=NO` and `-DENABLE_STATIC_FRAMEWORK=YES` can be added to the generate command.
- The CMake cross-compilation documentation mentions that with the Xcode generator it is possible to generate only one build system (i.e. have only one `-G` command) without specifying the SDK, and then selecting the SDK during the `--build` step with `-sdk <sdk-name>`. The same documentation also gives a warning that taking this shortcut might cause problems with commands such as `find_package()` or `find_library()`. To be on the safe side our example therefore does not use the shortcut.

### Xcode's old/new build system

If you see an Xcode build error "unable to attach DB" then you are likely affected by an incompatibility between the way how CMake handles `IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED` and the Xcode build system. Depending on the combination of versions of Xcode and CMake that you have, if you still want to use `IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED` you may therefore need to select the old or the new Xcode build system.

Some background information:

- Xcode 10 introduced a new build system, Xcode 13 deprecated the old build system and XCode 14 completely removed the old build system.
- Since CMake 3.19 you can specify `-T buildsystem=<value>` to a CMake generator command (a command using the `-G` option) to select the Xcode build system to be used later on in the `--build` step.
- Value "1" selects the old build system, value "12" selects the new build system. By default CMake selects the new build system.

## Codesigning when building for iOS

For iOS builds the project default is to **not** build the shared library, shared library framework, unit tests or the examples. The reason is that when built for the device these binaries all require codesigning, but since the project does not provide a codesigning identity the build would just fail.

The following example shows how you can force the shared library to be built with a codesigning identity of your own.

    cmake .. -G Xcode \
      [...]  # same options as shown in the cross-compiling section
      -DENABLE_SHARED_LIBRARY=YES \
      -DCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=<identity>

**Note:** You can find out your codesigning identy with this command: `xcrun security find-identity -v -p codesigning`. It's the long hex string at the start of the output.

## Deployment target when building for iOS

When you build SgfcKit for iOS you may encounter errors because some dependencies require a certain minimum iOS version. Known cases:

- libsgfc++ requires iOS 13 or newer because of its usage of `std::filesystem`
- The unit test library (Catch2) contains code that is available only since iOS 10.0.

If you have these errors you have to set the deployment target to 13.0. The deployment target is set with the CMake option `-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.0`.

## Bundle identifier when building for iOS

Should you try to build unit tests or the examples for iOS you will encounter an obstacle: The unit test runner and the examples are both executables, so they need to be codesigned, but unlike a shared library an executable can only be codesigned if it has a bundle identifier.

The project does not provide any bundle identifiers, so if you insist on building the unit tests and/or the examples for iOS that is something you have to provide. There is currently no example how to build bundles - a starting point would be the [CMake documentation for MACOSX_BUNDLE](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/MACOSX_BUNDLE.html).
