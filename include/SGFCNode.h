/// @brief The SGFCNode class provides access to the data of a single
/// SGF node in a tree of SGF nodes. SGFCNode also provides methods to
/// navigate the game tree. SGFCNode provides no methods to manipulate the
/// game tree - use SGFCTreeBuilder for that purpose.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
/// @ingroup game-tree
///
/// SGFCNode does not provide a stable object identity for the node objects
/// returned by its properties. For instance if you invoke the @e firstChild
/// property two times in a row and then compare the object references you will
/// find that they are different. However, the two objects will compare as
/// equal so that they can be properly used within collections.
///
/// @verbatim
/// SGFCNode* aNode = [...]

/// SGFCNode* firstChild1 = aNode.firstChild;

/// BOOL objectsHaveSameIdentity = (firstChild1 == firstChild2);     // NO
/// BOOL objectsAreEqual = ([firstChild1 isEqual:firstChild2]);      // YES
/// BOOL nodesAreEqual = ([firstChild1 isEqualToNode:firstChild2]);  // YES

/// NSMutableDictionary aDictionary = [...]
