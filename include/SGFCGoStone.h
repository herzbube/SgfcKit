/// @ingroup public-api

///
/// A Go stone on a Go board is defined by its color and by its location on
/// the Go board. SGFCGoStone stores an SGFCColor value and a reference to an
/// SGFCGoPoint object to record these two pieces of information.
///
/// A Go stone for which the location on the Go board is not known, or that
/// is not located on the board at all, does not store a reference to an
/// SGFCGoPoint object.
///
/// Do @b NOT attempt to create an SGFCGoStone object yourself, instead
/// always use the SGFCGoStone object provided by other library objects (e.g.
/// an SGFCGoStonePropertyValue instance).
