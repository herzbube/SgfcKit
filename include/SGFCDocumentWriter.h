/// @brief The SGFCDocumentWriter interface provides functions to generate
/// SGF data from SGFCDocument objects and to either write that data to the
/// filesystem or make it available as an in-memory string.
/// SGFCDocumentWriter operates the SGFC backend to achieve its task. Use
/// SGFCKitFactory to construct new SGFCDocumentWriter objects.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
/// @ingroup sgfc-frontend
/// @ingroup document
///
/// Before SGFCDocumentWriter can invoke the SGFC backend's write function
/// it generates SGF data from the SGFCDocument whose content should be
/// written, then passes the SGF data through the SGFC backend's load/parse
/// functions for data validation. For this to work SGFCDocumentWriter has
/// to perform escaping of characters in the SGF data that are also used for
/// the SGF skeleton. See the SGF specification if you don't know what
/// "escaping" is about.
///
/// As the SGF skeleton is made up of ASCII characters only, the characters
/// that require escaping are all ASCII characters. But the SGF standard
/// allows SimpleText and Text property values to have a non-ASCII
/// character encoding. SGFCDocumentWriter doesn't care about the actual
/// character encoding that is in use, it simply scans property values for
/// characters to escape on the byte level. This means that the character
/// encoding used for property values of type SimpleText and Text
/// must be a character encoding that is "ASCII-safe".
///
/// ASCII-safe means:
/// - The character encoding must encode ASCII characters with their single
///   byte values from the ASCII table; and
/// - The character encoding must not use the byte values of ASCII characters
///   to encode anything else but ASCII characters.
///
/// For instance, the ASCII character "]" has the hex value 0x5d in the ASCII
/// table. The character encoding must therefore use 0x5d to encode the
/// character "]", and it must guarantee that, regardless of what else is
/// encoded, the value 0x5d does not appear anywhere in the encoded byte
/// stream except to encode the character "]".
///
/// Single-byte character encodings such as the ISO-8859 family usually are
/// ASCII-safe because they have been designed like that. Multi-byte
/// encodings, however, should not be considered ASCII-safe unless they are
/// known to be. Big5 and Shift_JIS are notable examples that are @b not
/// ASCII-safe. UTF-8 is a notable example that @b is ASCII-safe.
///
/// As already mentioned SGFCDocumentWriter passes the SGF data it has
/// generated and escaped to the SGFC backend's load/parse functions, using
/// the arguments that arguments() returns at that point. The processing
/// is almost exactly the same as when SGFCDocumentReader had been used to
/// read the SGF data. If the library client does not do anything special,
/// this is the default behaviour:
/// - #SGFCArgumentTypeEncodingMode 1 is used.
/// - The first CA property value determines the encoding to use.
/// - #SGFCArgumentTypeDefaultEncoding UTF-8 is used if there is no
///   CA property value.
///
/// The last point is the only difference to SGFCDocumentReader, which uses
/// #SGFCArgumentTypeDefaultEncoding ISO-8859-1. SGFCDocumentWriter uses
/// UTF-8 because it assumes that library clients work with UTF-8. A library
/// client that wants a different default encoding must change the arguments
/// returned by arguments().
