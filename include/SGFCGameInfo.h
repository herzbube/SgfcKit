/// @brief The SGFCGameInfo interface ia a collection of meta data that
/// describes one SGF game. For instance, the meta data includes information
/// such as the name of the game, when and where it was played, by whom, etc.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
/// @ingroup property-value
/// @ingroup game
///
/// SGFCGame or SGFCNode can be queried to provide an SGFCGameInfo object.
/// The object is newly created and contains a snapshot of the property values
/// of a few root properties (#SGFCPropertyCategoryRoot) and all game info
/// properties (#SGFCPropertyCategoryGameInfo) found in the root node and the
/// game info node, respectively, at the time the query is made.
///
/// @note It is not possible to distinguish between a property that was not
/// present in the root or game info node, and a property that was present
/// in the root or game info but had the default property value.
///
/// Alternatively a new but empty SGFCGameInfo object can be created via
/// SGFCKitFactory and then populated with data as the library client
/// sees fit. The empty SGFCGameInfo object is initialized with default
/// values.
///
/// The values that an SGFCGameInfo object holds can be written to an
/// SGFCGame or SGFCNode. The values are converted to properties and
/// property values that are then stored in the root node and the game info
/// node, respectively. Properties and property values that already exist at
/// that time are overwritten.
///
/// @note It is not possible to write a property with its default value.
///
/// Root property values are read-only - they must be provided at the time the
/// SGFCGameInfo object is constructed and cannot be changed later on. The
/// reason is that changing these values in an SGFCGameInfo object that was
/// captured from a game tree and then later writing the SGFCGameInfo object
/// data back to the game tree would likely invalidate most if not all of the
/// game tree's data.
///
/// @attention SGFCGameInfo or SGFCGoGameInfo form a class cluster. Do @b not
/// attempt to subclass SGFCGameInfo or SGFCGoGameInfo! Always use the
/// convenience constructors and initializers from the SGFCGameInfo class
/// to create objects - they will automatically provide you with an
/// SGFCGoGameInfo object when the root node parameter indicates that it is
/// appropriate, i.e. when the game type is #SGFCGameTypeGo.
