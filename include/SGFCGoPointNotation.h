  /// @brief The notation of the SGF standard for representing a Go Point
  /// location. Example: "fq".
  ///
  /// The SGF standard defines the following notation:
  /// - The coordinate system's origin is in the upper-left corner of the
  ///   board.
  /// - Positions on both axis are labeled with letters, starting with a
  ///   lowercase "a" at the coordinate system's origin and progressing
  ///   towards a lowercase "z". This allows 26 positions in both directions.
  ///   If the Go board dimension is larger than 26 then labeling continues
  ///   with uppercase letters. The lowercase letter "z" is followed by the
  ///   uppercase letter "A". The sequence looks like this: a...zA...Z.
  /// - The SGF notation of a point location (which corresponds to the raw SGF
  ///   property string) consists of two letters: The first letter designates
  ///   the x-axis, the second the y-axis. Examples: "aa", "fq", "Sc", etc.
  /// - The maximum board size that can be used with the SGF notation is
  ///   52x52.

  /// @brief The "1-1" figure notation for representing a Go Point location.
  /// Example: "6-17".
  ///
  /// The "1-1" figure notation is defined like this:
  /// - The coordinate system's origin is in the upper-left corner of the
  ///   board.
  /// - Positions on both axis are labeled with figures that correspond to
  ///   numeric values. The first figure / numeric value at the coordinate
  ///   system's origin is "1", figures / numeric values then progress by
  ///   increases of 1.
  /// - The "1-1" figure notation of a point location consists of two figures
  ///   separated by a dash character ("-"). The first figure designates the
  ///   x-axis, the second the y-axis. Examples: "1-1", "6-17", "45-3", etc.
  /// - In theory the "1-1" figure notation can be used for arbitrary board
  ///   sizes, but in practice SGF limits the board size to a maximum of
  ///   52x52.

  /// @brief The "A1" hybrid notation for representing a Go Point location.
  /// Example: "F17".
  ///
  /// The "A1" hybrid notation is defined like this:
  /// - The coordinate system's origin is in the lower-left corner of the
  ///   board.
  /// - Positions on the x-axis are labeled with uppercase letters, starting
  ///   with an uppercase "A" at the coordinate system's origin and
  ///   progressing towards an uppercase "Z". The letter "I" is not used to
  ///   avoid confusion with "J".
  /// - Positions on the y-axis are labeled with numbers, starting with 1 at
  ///   the coordinate system's origin and progressing by increases of 1.
  /// - The "A1" figure notation of a point location consists of a letter
  ///   followed by a number without any separator. The letter designates the
  ///   x-axis, the number the y-axis. Examples: "A1", "F17".
  /// - The maximum board size that can be used with the "A1" hybrid notation
  ///   is 25x25. The maximum is not 26x26 because of the unused letter "I".
