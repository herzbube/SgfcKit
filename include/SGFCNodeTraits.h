/// @brief file

/// @brief An SGFCNodeTraits value describes the traits of an
/// SGFCNode object. The value is a combination of individual flags
/// defined in the SGFCNodeTrait enumeration.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
///
/// All bitwise operators have been overloaded to make the SGFCNodeTraits
/// typedef interoperate with the SGFCNodeTrait enumeration as
/// conveniently as possible. There are some limitations, though, because
/// SGFCNodeTraits is a typedef and not a true type (i.e. it's not a
/// class or struct). For instance, the assignment operator cannot be
/// overloaded so it's not possible to assign an SGFCNodeTrait enumeration
/// member directly to an SGFCNodeTraits variable. Consequently, whenever
/// SGFCNodeTrait (the enum type) needs to be treated interchangeably with
/// SGFCNodeTraits (the typdef) a static_cast must be done. This works
/// because SGFCNodeTraits (the typedef) is used as the underlying type
/// of SGFCNodeTrait (the enum type).
///
/// @verbatim
/// SGFCNodeTraits traits = static_cast<SGFCNodeTraits>(SGFCNodeTraitInheritable);

/// typedef is important to make the bitwise operators, specifically the
/// shift left and shift right operators, unambiguous and safe to use.
