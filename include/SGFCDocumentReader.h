/// @brief The SGFCDocumentReader interface provides functions to generate
/// SGFCDocument objects by reading SGF data from the filesystem or from
/// in-memory data. SGFCDocumentReader operates the SGFC backend to achieve
/// its task. Use SGFCKitFactory to construct new SGFCDocumentReader
/// objects.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
/// @ingroup sgfc-frontend
/// @ingroup document
///
/// SGFCDocumentReader invokes the SGFC backend's load/parse functions using
/// the arguments that arguments() returns. If the library client does not
/// do anything special, this is the default behaviour:
/// - #SGFCArgumentTypeEncodingMode 1 is used.
/// - The first CA property value found in the SGF data determines the
///   encoding to use.
/// - #SGFCArgumentTypeDefaultEncoding ISO-8859-1 is used if there is no
///   CA property value.
///
/// When #SGFCArgumentTypeEncodingMode 1 or 2 are used the SGFC backend
/// converts the SGF data it reads into memory to UTF-8. However, without
/// further measures the document object tree would still contain whatever
/// CA property values were found in the SGF data. If these values are not
/// UTF-8 then the document object tree would now contain wrong information
/// about the encoding used in-memory. This would be a problem if, for
/// instance, the document object tree were passed to SGFCDocumentWriter,
/// because the writer would then use the wrong CA property values. To avoid
/// this situation SGFCDocumentReader performs the following manipulations
/// of the document object tree after the read operation is complete:
/// - If #SGFCArgumentTypeEncodingMode 1 or 2 were used for reading
///   SGFCDocumentReader writes the CA property value "UTF-8" into the root
///   node of each SGFCGame it finds in the document. Only the root node
///   needs to be treated such because the CA property is a root property
///   which according to the SGF standard is only allowed in the root node.
///   Note that the SGFC backend deletes any CA properties that it finds
///   outside of a root node.
/// - If #SGFCArgumentTypeEncodingMode 3 was used for reading
///   SGFCDocumentReader does not write a CA property value because the SGF
///   data was read into memory as-is.
