/// @brief An SGFCPropertyTraits value describes the traits of an
/// SGFCProperty object. The value is a combination of individual flags
/// defined in the SGFCPropertyTrait enumeration.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
///
/// All bitwise operators have been overloaded to make the SGFCPropertyTraits
/// typedef interoperate with the SGFCPropertyTrait enumeration as
/// conveniently as possible. There are some limitations, though, because
/// SGFCPropertyTraits is a typedef and not a true type (i.e. it's not a
/// class or struct). For instance, the assignment operator cannot be
/// overloaded so it's not possible to assign an SGFCPropertyTrait enumeration
/// member directly to an SGFCPropertyTraits variable. Consequently, whenever
/// SGFCPropertyTrait (the enum type) needs to be treated interchangeably with
/// SGFCPropertyTraits (the typdef) a static_cast must be done. This works
/// because SGFCPropertyTraits (the typedef) is used as the underlying type
/// of SGFCPropertyTrait (the enum type).
