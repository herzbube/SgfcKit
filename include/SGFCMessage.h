/// @brief The SGFCMessage class represents a message that is generated
/// when SGF data is loaded and parsed, or when SGF data is saved. Most
/// messages are generated by SGFC, but there are a few error cases where
/// SgfcKit also generates messages. SGFCMessage objects are immutable.
///
/// When a message is generated by SGFC, the raw message text follows
/// formatting guidelines that are published in the SGFC documentation.
/// SgfcKit makes an effort to parse the raw message text so that it can
/// make the message content available to clients in a structured manner via
/// SGFCMessage.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
/// @ingroup sgfc-message
///
/// Do @b NOT attempt to create an SGFCMessage object yourself, instead
/// always use the SGFCMessage objects provided by other library objects (e.g.
/// an SGFCDocumentReaderResult instance).
@interface SGFCMessage : NSObject

/// @brief Do @b NOT use this initializer, it always raises
/// SGFCInvalidOperationException.

/// @exception SGFCInvalidOperationException Is raised whenever this initializer
/// is invoked.

/// @brief Returns the message's identification number. Returns zero or a
/// positive number if the message was generated by SGFC. Returns a negative
/// number if the message was generated by SgfcKit.

/// Every message generated by SGFC has its own unique message ID. Consult
/// the SGFC documentation for a list of message IDs. SGFC calls them
/// "error codes". The exception is when SgfcKit is unable to determine
/// the message ID when it parses the raw message text - if that happens
/// SgfcKit sets the message ID to #SGFCUnknownSgfcMessageID.
///
/// Every message generated by SgfcKit also has its own unique message
/// ID. Documented constants for these are available in SGFCConstants.
/// Messages generated by SgfcKit are always fatal errors.

/// For messages generated by SGFC this is the raw message text minus

/// SGFC this message text can therefore differ from the original raw
/// message text in the amount or kind of whitespace used.
