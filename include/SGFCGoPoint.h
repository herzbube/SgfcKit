/// @brief The SGFCGoPoint class represents a point on a Go board.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
/// @ingroup go
///
/// A point on a Go board is an intersection of two lines. A point's location
/// is identified by a position in a two-dimensional coordinate system. The
/// horizontal axis is the x-axis, sometimes also called column. The vertical
/// axis is the y-axis, sometimes also called row.
///
/// SGFCGoPoint has methods that make the point location available
/// as numeric values in several coordinate systems (enumerated in
/// SGFCCoordinateSystem). There are two methods: One for the x-axis
/// position and one for the y-axis position. Both provide 1-based values.
///
/// In addition SGFCGoPoint has methods that make the point location
/// available as string values in several notations (enumerated in
/// SGFCGoPointNotation). There are three methods:
/// - One method that provides the location as a single string value.
/// - And two methods that provide the x-axis and y-axis compounds of
///   the location, respectively, as two separate string values.
///
/// Do @b NOT attempt to create an SGFCGoPoint object yourself, instead
/// always use the SGFCGoPoint object provided by other library objects (e.g.
/// an SGFCGoPointPropertyValue instance).
@interface SGFCGoPoint : NSObject

/// @brief Returns the 1-based numeric x-axis position of the point in the

/// xPositionInGoPointNotation:() and yPositionInGoPointNotation:()
/// return a non-empty string for the desired notation @a goPointNotation.
/// Returns NO if these methods return an empty string.
///
/// The methods may return an empty string if the desired notation cannot
/// represent the point location. See the documentation of each
/// SgfcGoPointNotation enum value for a definition of the notation and its
/// limitations. Notably, the "A1" hybrid notation cannot represent
/// point locations with an x- or y-axis position greater than 25.
