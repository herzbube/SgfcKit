/// @brief The SGFCGoMove class represents a move in a Go game.
///
/// A move in a Go game is defined by the color of the player who made the
/// move and, if it is not a pass move, by the location of the stone that was
/// placed by the move on the Go board. SGFCGoMove uses a reference to an
/// SGFCGoStone object to record the latter of these two pieces of
/// information.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
/// @ingroup go
///
/// Do @b NOT attempt to create an SGFCGoMove object yourself, instead
/// always use the SGFCGoMove object provided by other library objects (e.g.
/// an SGFCGoMovePropertyValue instance).
@interface SGFCGoMove : NSObject
{

/// @brief Do @b NOT use this initializer, it always raises
/// SGFCInvalidOperationException.
///
/// @exception SGFCInvalidOperationException Is raised whenever this initializer
/// is invoked.

/// @brief Returns the color of the player who made the move.
///
/// If isPassMove() returns NO, this method returns the same value as
/// the SGFCGoStone::GetColor() method of the SGFCGoStone object returned
/// by stone().
@property(nonatomic, readonly) SGFCColor playerColor;

/// @brief Returns the location of the stone that was placed by the move on
/// the Go board. Returns @e nil if isPassMove() returns YES.
///
/// Also returns @e nil if isPassMove() returns NO but the location
/// of the stone that was placed by the move on the Go board is not known.
/// This special case may occur if this SGFCGoMove object is constructed
/// during parsing of SGF content and the move property's value for some
/// reason could not be interpreted.
///
/// This is a convenience method that returns the same value as the
/// SGFCGoStone::location() property of the SGFCGoStone object returned
/// by stone().
