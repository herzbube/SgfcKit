/// @brief The SGFCGoMove class represents a move in a Go game.
///
/// A move in a Go game is defined by the color of the player who made the
/// move and, if it is not a pass move, by the location of the stone that was
/// placed by the move on the Go board. SGFCGoMove uses a reference to an
/// SGFCGoStone object to record the latter of these two pieces of
/// information.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
/// @ingroup go
///
/// Do @b NOT attempt to create an SGFCGoMove object yourself, instead
/// always use the SGFCGoMove object provided by other library objects (e.g.
/// an SGFCGoMovePropertyValue instance).

/// by stone().
