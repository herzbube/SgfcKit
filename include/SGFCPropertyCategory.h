  /// As per the SGF standard, game info properties are usually (but not

  /// #SGFCNodeTraitRoot. When several game trees are located below a common
  /// root node, game info properties are stored in the nodes where a game
  /// first becomes distinguishable from all other games in the tree.

  /// As per the SGF standard, there may be only one game info node on any
  /// path within a tree of nodes, i.e. if some game info properties occur in

  /// - On the path from the root node to this node.
  /// - In the subtree below this node.
