/// @brief The SGFCGame clas provides access to the data of one SGF
/// game tree, in the form of a tree of SGFCNode objects.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
/// @ingroup game-tree
///
/// Each branch in the game tree is either a separate game, or a variation in
/// game play for its parent game. A tree without branches is a single game
/// without variations.
///
/// A list of games can be obtained by invoking gameInfoNodes().
///
/// According to the SGF standard, the game tree's root node must contain
/// root properties, which are used to define some global "attributes" that
/// affect all games. Notably these include the game type and the board size.
/// This means that if a game tree contains multiple games, all of them must
/// have the same game type and the same board size.

///   on any path within a tree of nodes. If the root node contains at

///   only the root node. Since game info properties are usually stored in
///   the root node this is actually the expected outcome for most of the
///   SGF content out there.
