/// @brief The SGFCRoundInformation struct is a simple type that can hold the
/// decomposed values of an #SGFCPropertyTypeRO property value.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
/// @ingroup property-value
/// @ingroup game
///
/// The SGF standard specifies that the #SGFCPropertyTypeRO property value
/// should be written as "xx (tt)", where "xx" is the number of the round and
/// "(tt)" the type of the round. SGFCRoundInformationFromPropertyValue()
/// can be used to convert from such a composite property value to an
/// SGFCRoundInformation object, which holds the decomposed values, while
/// SGFCRoundInformationToPropertyValue() stitches the decomposed values in
/// an SGFCRoundInformation object back together to a composite property
/// value.
///
/// @note It is safe to pass around copies of SGFCRoundInformation even though
/// it contains references to Objective-C objects. These are strong references
/// and ARC will take care of retaining/releasing these objects at the
/// appropriate time (e.g. when SGFCRoundInformation is copied or when
/// SGFCRoundInformation goes out of scope).

// object, the compiler issues an incompatibility warning. The warnings are
// misleading, though, because we don't intend the code to be compiled for /
// used by C - we intend it to be compiled for / used by Objective-C.
// Because of this we suppress the misleading compiler warnings with the
// following pragmas.
