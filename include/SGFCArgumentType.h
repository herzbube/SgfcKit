/// @brief SGFCArgumentType enumerates the arguments that can be passed on to
/// SGFC when it reads or writes SGF content.
///
/// @ingroup public-api
///
/// Some arguments have a parameter, but most arguments do not. Unless
/// documented otherwise an argument does not have a parameter.
///
/// Some of the arguments with parameters can be specified multiple times.
/// Unless documented otherwise an argument can be specified only once.
///
/// Some arguments are specific for games of type Go (GM[1]), but most
/// arguments are generic. Unless documented otherwise an argument works for
/// all game types.
///
/// The following SGFC command line options are not supported as SGFC
/// arguments by SgfcKit:
/// - Option -k. The library currently does not support preserving the
///   header in front of the SGF data. See the libsgfc++ GitHub issue #24 for
///   details on this decision.
/// - Option -g. The library currently does not support game signatures.
/// - Option -v. The library currently does not support querying the SGFC
///   version.
/// - Option -s. The library currently does not support splitting a game
///   collection into separate files when writing out SGF content. This is
///   a limitation when working with ISgfcCommandLine. When working with
///   ISgfcDocumentWriter the library client can implement the splitting
///   function itself by writing out documents with a single game tree only.
/// - Option -c. Unlike the SGFC command line program, the library gives the
///   client free rein in writing out SGF content even when it was read with
///   critical errors. It is the library client's job to examine the parse
///   results and take appropriate steps when it encounters critical errors.
/// - Options -i, -h and --help. The library does not support these options
///   because they are useful only for an interactive command line program.
/// - Option -U. The library client can achieve the same by specifying
///   #SGFCArgumentTypeDefaultEncoding with parameter "UTF-8".
typedef NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, SGFCArgumentType)
{
  /// @brief Select how to search for the beginning of SGF data. This argument
  /// requires a numeric parameter value 1, 2 or 3. The corresponding SGFC
  /// command line option is -bx.
  ///
  /// The argument is invalid if you specify a parameter value that is not
  /// 1, 2 or 3.
  ///
  /// The parameter values 1-3 have the following meaning:
  /// - 1 = Advanced search algorithm (default)
  /// - 2 = First occurence of "(;"
  /// - 3 = First occurence of "("
  ///
  /// The advanced search algorithm can be said to be a combination of
  /// the more simple and straightforward algorithms 2 and 3. SGFC basically
  /// searches for "(;", but some erroneous files mark the beginning only
  /// with "(". To detect such files SGFC uses a more sophisticated search.
  /// In rare cases this might go wrong, so if you find yourself in that
  /// position you may wish to use the algorithm 2 or 3.

  /// @brief Select how to interpret line breaks when reading Text property
  /// values. This argument requires a numeric parameter value 1, 2, 3 or 4.
  /// The corresponding SGFC command line option is -lx.
  ///
  /// This argument only affects how SGFC interprets SGF content during
  /// reading. When SGFC writes SGF content the output is always in FF4
  /// format.
  ///
  /// The argument is invalid if you specify a parameter value that is not
  /// 1, 2, 3 or 4.
  ///
  /// The parameter values 1-4 have the following meaning:
  /// - 1 = A line break preceded by a backslash ("\") character is treated
  ///       as a soft line break. All other line breaks are treated as a hard
  ///       line break. This is the default behaviour.
  /// - 2 = A line break preceded by a backslash ("\") character is treated
  ///       as a soft line break. A line break preceded by a space character
  ///       is converted to a space character (the result is that there are
  ///       now two space characters, the one that was in the original SGF
  ///       content and the one that was created by converting the line
  ///       break). All other line breaks are treated as a hard line break.
  ///       The SGFC documentation indicates that the MS-DOS/Windows
  ///       application "MGT" writes SGF content in this format.
  /// - 3 = A line break preceded by a backslash ("\") character is treated
  ///       as a soft line break. A single line break is converted to a space
  ///       character. Two line breaks are treated as a hard line break.
  /// - 4 = Experimentally determined that this seems to be almost the same
  ///       as parameter value 3. The distinction seems to be that the double
  ///       line break is preserved on writing. The SGFC documentation
  ///       characterizes this line break behaviour as "paragraph style
  ///       (ISHI format, MFGO)".
  ///
  /// @todo Find out more about parameter value 4. What does "paragraph style"
  /// mean? What is the ISHI format? MFGO is likely the abbreviation for the
  /// Go playing application "Many Faces of Go".
  SGFCArgumentTypeHardLineBreakMode,

  /// @brief When writing SGF content try to make each line end at the end of
  /// a node. The corresponding SGFC command line option is -L.
  ///
  /// This argument affects how SGFC formats the output when it writes SGF
  /// content:
  /// - By default SGFC attempts to keep the line length to a certain maximum.
  ///   If that length were to be exceeded SGFC inserts a line break before it
  ///   writes out the next property. In case of a Text property SGFC inserts
  ///   a soft line break in the middle of the property value.
  /// - When this argument is specified, SGFC instead focuses on keeping a
  ///   node's content on the same line, inserting a line break before it
  ///   writes out the next node. This can lead to longer lines being written
  ///   when a node has many properties or properties have many values. Also
  ///   SGFC does not insert soft line breaks in the middle of a Text property
  ///   value.
  SGFCArgumentTypeLineBreakAtEndOfNode,

  /// @brief Do not insert soft line breaks into Text values. The
  /// corresponding SGFC command line option is -t.

  ///   a soft line break in the middle of the property value.
  /// - When this argument is specified, SGFC never inserts soft line breaks
  ///   in the middle of a Text property value.
  ///
  /// Old SGF handling applications that pre-date FF4 cannot deal with soft

  /// applications you should specify this argument to avoid soft line breaks.
  SGFCArgumentTypeNoSoftLineBreaksInTextValues,

  /// @brief Delete markup on current move. This argument works only for games
  /// of type Go (GM[1]). The corresponding SGFC command line option is -m.
  ///
  /// Definition of "markup on current move":
  /// - A node contains a move property (e.g. B[aa]).
  /// - The same node also contains a markup property (MA, CR, TR, SQ, SL).
  /// - The markup property marks the point on which the move in the same
  ///   node played a stone.
  ///
  /// Some Go game servers create SGF files where the current move is marked
  /// with e.g. a circle (CR[]). Some people find this annoying. Specifying
  /// this argument tells SGFC to delete any markup properties on the position
  /// of the current move.
  ///
  /// @note When a markup property is deleted because of this argument type,
  /// this results in an error type message with
  /// #SGFCMessageIDPositionNotUnique. Example:
  /// "Markup <CR> position not unique ([partially] deleted)".
  SGFCArgumentTypeDeleteMarkupOnCurrentMove,

  /// @brief Delete empty nodes, i.e. nodes that contain no properties. The

  SGFCArgumentTypeDeleteEmptyNodes,

  /// @brief Delete obsolete properties, i.e. properties that are not part of
  /// FF4. The corresponding SGFC command line option is -o.
  ///
  /// SGFC knows all FF4 properties (general ones and Go specific ones) and
  /// all FF1-FF3 properties. Properties that are defined only in FF1-FF3 but

  /// SGFC deletes all such obsolete properties it encounters. Exceptions:
  /// - "L" is converted to its FF4 counterpart "LB".
  /// - "M" is converted to an FF4 counterpart, either "MA" or "TR".
  ///
  /// @note When an obsolete property is deleted because of this argument
  /// type, this results in a warning type message with

  /// "property <EL> is not defined in FF[4] (parsing done anyway)".
  SGFCArgumentTypeDeleteObsoleteProperties,

  /// @brief Delete unknown properties, i.e. properties that are not part of
  /// FF1-FF4. The corresponding SGFC command line option is -u.
  ///
  /// SGFC knows all FF4 properties (general ones and Go specific ones) and

  /// encounters. Exceptions:
  /// - The "KI" property, which is a private property of the
  ///   "Smart Game Board" application (SGB), is converted to its FF4
  ///   counterpart "KM".
  ///
  /// @note When an unknown property is deleted because of this argument
  /// type, this results in a warning type message with
  /// #SGFCMessageIDUnknownPropertyDeleted. Example:
  /// "unknown property <XX> deleted".
  SGFCArgumentTypeDeleteUnknownProperties,

  /// @brief Delete properties of a given property type. This argument
  /// requires an SGFCPropertyType parameter value, the value denotes the
  /// properties to delete. This option can be specified multiple times. The
  /// corresponding SGFC command line option is -yP.
  ///
  /// SGFC converts certain obsolete and unknown properties to an FF4

  /// to specify #SGFCPropertyTypeL do delete this property.
  ///
  /// The SGFCPropertyType enumeration contains a number of values for

  ///
  /// @note When a property is deleted because of this argument type, this
  /// results in a warning type message with
  /// #SGFCMessageIDRequestedPropertyDeleted. Example:
  /// "property <FF> deleted".
  SGFCArgumentTypeDeletePropertyType,

  /// @brief Write pass moves as "[tt]" if possible. This argument works only
  /// for games of type Go (GM[1]). The corresponding SGFC command line option
  /// is -p.
  ///
  /// The Go-specific part of FF4 specifies that pass moves should be written
  /// with an empty property value (e.g. B[]). For compatibility with FF3
  /// the value "tt" is still allowed, though (e.g. B[tt]). Specifying this
  /// argument causes SGFC to write pass moves out using the old "tt"
  /// notation. This is only possible if the board size is <= 19x19, because
  /// for board sizes 20x20 and larger the value "tt" refers to a valid
  /// location on the board. So for board sizes 20x20 and larger, SGFC writes
  /// a pass move with an empty property value even if this argument is
  /// specified.
  SGFCArgumentTypeUseOldPassMoveNotation,

  /// @brief Enable restrictive checking. The corresponding SGFC command line
  /// option is -r.
  ///
  /// If this argument is set then SGFC is even more pedantic than usual. The
  /// argument is designed to flag all kinds of bad style or uncommon
  /// characteristics that can cause problems with applications that are just
  /// able to deal with common cases. For example, if the SGF content contains
  /// more than one game tree SGFC now issues an error instead of a warning.
  ///
  /// Furthermore for games of type Go (GM[1]) SGFC now checks that no two
  /// successive moves have the same color, that no setup properties
  /// (AB/AW/AE) appear in the main branch apart from the root node, and that
  /// the "HA" property is set correctly.
  SGFCArgumentTypeEnableRestrictiveChecking,

  /// @brief Correct variation level and root moves. Variation level
  /// correction works only for games of type Go (GM[1]). The corresponding
  /// SGFC command line option is -v.
  ///
  /// It is bad style to have alternative moves at different tree levels. Some
  /// applications chose that way to represent variations as siblings instead
  /// of children - they add a child node, remove the latest move by using an
  /// "AE" property and put the alternative move into the node. When this
  /// argument is specified SGFC tries to correct such variations. Note that
  /// this kind of corrective action works only for games of type Go (GM[1]).
  ///
  /// Example: >>(;GM[1];B[aa](;W[bb])(;AE[aa]B[cc])(;AE[aa]B[dd]))<<
  /// Correct: >>(;GM[1](;B[aa];W[bb])(;B[cc])(;B[dd]))<<
  ///
  /// Another bad style is having the first move in the root node of a game
  /// tree. When this argument is specified SGFC splits the root node into
  /// two nodes and moves the first move into the second node. Note that this
  /// kind of corrective action works for all game types.
  ///
  /// Example: >>(;GM[1]C[first move in root node]GC[bad style]B[aa])<<
  /// Correct: >>(;GM[1]GC[good style];B[aa]C[first move not in root node])<<
  ///
  /// @note Variation fixes and root move fixes made because of this argument
  /// type result in warning type messages with
  /// #SGFCMessageIDVariationLevelCorrected and
  /// #SGFCMessageIDMoveInRootNodeSplit, respectively.
  /// Examples: "variation level corrected" and "move in root node found
  /// (splitted node into two)".
  SGFCArgumentTypeCorrectVariationLevelAndRootMoves,

  /// @brief Reverse ordering of variations. The corresponding SGFC command
  /// line option is -z.
  ///
  /// It is bad style to have the main line of the game not in the main branch
  /// (variation "A"). When this argument is specified SGFC reverses the
  /// ordering of all variations in a game tree, assuming that the main line
  /// of the game is actually in the last branch. Example: Variations A,B,C,D
  /// are reordered as D,C,B,A.
  ///
  /// The function can reorder only up to a hardcoded limit of variations
  /// of a single node. If you hit this limit you need to adjust the
  /// preprocessor macro MAX_REORDER_VARIATIONS in file all.h to a higher
  /// value and recompile SGFC and libsgfc++.
  SGFCArgumentTypeReverseVariationOrdering,

  /// @brief When writing SGF content, expand compressed point lists. This
  /// argument works only for games of type Go (GM[1]). The corresponding SGFC
  /// command line option is -e.
  ///
  /// This argument affects how SGFC formats the output when it writes SGF
  /// content:
  /// - By default when the game type is Go (GM[1]) and SGFC encounters a
  ///   property with a point list value type (e.g. property "MA"), it
  ///   attempts to compress the point values to take advantage of the FF4
  ///   "compressed point lists" format. If SGFC reads in SGF content that
  ///   already contains point lists in the compressed format, it retains the
  ///   compressed format when writing the SGF content.
  /// - When this argument is specified, SGFC does not compress uncompressed
  ///   point lists, and it actively expands point lists that were in the
  ///   compressed format in the original SGF content.
  ///
  /// Old SGF handling applications that pre-date FF4 cannot deal with the
  /// compressed format. If you are concerned about compatibility to old
  /// applications you should specify this argument to avoid compressed point
  /// lists.
  ///
  /// @note After reading in SGF content point lists are always made
  /// available to the library client in uncompressed form in the document
  /// object tree.
  SGFCArgumentTypeExpandCompressedPointLists,

  /// @brief Select how to determine the character encoding(s) used to decode
  /// SGF content. This argument requires a numeric parameter value 1, 2
  /// or 3. The corresponding SGFC command line option is -Ex.
  ///
  /// The argument is invalid if you specify a parameter value that is not
  /// 1, 2 or 3.
  ///
  /// The parameter values 1-3 have the following meaning:
  /// - Mode 1 (the default mode): A single encoding is used to decode the
  ///   @b entire SGF content. The encoding to use is detected by probing the
  ///   SGF content. If a Unicode BOM marker is found then the encoding
  ///   defined by that marker is used, but the first CA property in the
  ///   decoded SGF content must match the encoding detected from the BOM.
  ///   If no Unicode BOM marker is found then the SGF content is probed for
  ///   CA properties, and the first CA property value found is used as the
  ///   encoding. If no CA property is found the default encoding ISO-8859-1
  ///   is used. Note that only this mode allows the wide-character encodings
  ///   UTF-16 and UTF-32 to be processed (via BOM detection).
  /// - Mode 2 (specification conformant): A separate encoding is used to
  ///   decode each game tree in the SGF content. The encoding is defined by
  ///   the CA property value of that game tree. If a game tree has no CA
  ///   property the default encoding ISO-8859-1 is used. Only SimpleText and
  ///   Text property values are decoded! The SGF formatting skeleton as well
  ///   as property values that are not SimpleText or Text are parsed using
  ///   ASCII/ISO-8859-1.
  /// - Mode 3: No decoding takes place.
  ///
  /// @attention In SgfcKit you should @b never use parameter value 3! SgfcKit
  /// uses NSString everywhere and NSString is designed to hold a Unicode
  /// string. When SgfcKit obtains string data from libsgfc++ it has to specify
  /// an encoding with which to marshal the string data from the C++ string
  /// type std::string into NSString. SgfcKit assumes UTF-8, because that is the
  /// encoding in which libsgfc++ (and the underlying SGFC) provides string data
  /// when encoding modes 1 and 2 are used. If you use encoding mode 3 then you
  /// invalidate SgfcKit's assumption and you will get wrong data.
  ///
  /// @note Mode 2 is the behaviour as designed by the SGF standard. This is
  /// somewhat antiquated as it not only allows SGF content to be partially
  /// encoded, it even allows different encodings to be used within the same
  /// piece of SGF content. It also breaks the notion of SGF as text files.
  /// Mode 1, even though it does not conform to the SGF standard, is what
  /// most likely can be expected from modern-day applications that encode an
  /// entire file and use the same encoding for the entire file.
  ///
  /// @attention When mode 1 is used decoding occurs before parsing, when
  /// mode 2 is used decoding occurs after parsing. This can be important
  /// when SGF content is encoded with a multi-byte encoding, and one or
  /// more multi-byte characters contain bytes that correspond to ASCII
  /// characters that are relevant for the SGF format (escape character,
  /// property closing character).
  ///
  /// When mode 1 or 2 are used for reading, the SGF content is decoded and
  /// made available to the library client as UTF-8. Accordingly each decoded
  /// game tree's root node is populated with a CA property value "UTF-8".
  /// See the documentation of SGFCDocumentReader for details how this is
  /// done. When mode 3 is used no decoding takes place and the library client
  /// receives the SGF content as-is.
  ///
  /// When node 1 or 2 are used for @b writing, the SGF content in the
  /// object tree is internally decoded according to the rules documented
  /// above before it is actually written out. This allows library clients to
  /// provide content in encodings that are not UTF-8. Care must be taken not
  /// to mix encodings in the same  object tree! For instance a library client
  /// might first read SGF content from some source using encoding mode 1 or
  /// 2, which produces an object tree in UTF-8, then it could modify the
  /// object tree with values in an encoding that is @b not UTF-8. Writing
  /// out such an object tree that contains values in mixed encodings is
  /// likely to produce invalid results.
